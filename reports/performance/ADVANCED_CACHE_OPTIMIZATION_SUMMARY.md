## 🛠️ Technical Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Multi-Tier Caching Architecture
```
L1 Cache (Memory) → Ultra-fast access (0.5ms)
    ↓ miss
L2 Cache (Redis) → Fast persistent access (3ms)  
    ↓ miss
Data Source → Compute and cache (50ms)
```

### 2. Advanced Cache Manager Features
- **Dynamic TTL Calculation**: Access pattern-based TTL (0.5h - 2h)
- **Intelligent Cache Promotion**: L2 → L1 for frequently accessed data
- **Adaptive Eviction Strategies**: LRU, LFU, and Adaptive algorithms
- **Background Cache Warming**: Proactive data preloading
- **Smart Invalidation**: Selective and namespace-wide cleanup

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Redis Connection Pooling**: 20 concurrent connections
- **Async/Await Operations**: Non-blocking I/O
- **Data Compression**: zlib compression for large objects (>1KB)
- **Blake2b Hashing**: Fast and secure cache key generation
- **Access Pattern Tracking**: 24-hour rolling window analysis
